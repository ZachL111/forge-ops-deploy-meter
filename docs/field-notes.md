# Field Notes

The useful part of this repository is the small rule set around dry-run spread and operator cost.

The domain cases cover `dry-run spread`, `rename risk`, `operator cost`, and `idempotence`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

`recovery` tells me the happy path still works. `stress` tells me whether the guardrail still has teeth.

The language-specific addition keeps the review model in native modules with a direct node check.
